## Description
To build the back end of an E-Commerce site with Express.JS, MySQL, and Sequelize that allows the manager of an internet retail company to easily view, manage, and interact with information stored in a database. The Manger will be able to add, delete, update and view the information stored on the inventory database.    

## Actions Taken 
* Utilized MySQL to connect to the database using Sequelize.  
* Sourced schema and seed commands to create the database with the test data. 
* Completed code for the models and API routes. 
* Utilized insomnia to test the routes and ensure they're behaving as expected.
